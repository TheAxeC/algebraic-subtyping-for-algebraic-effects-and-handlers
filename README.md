# Algebraic Subtyping for Algebraic Effects and Handlers

## Bugs

### Evaluation

The notation for effects has changed: `#Op ()` has changed into `perform (Op ())

    => change this by manually changing the parsers

### Optimization

    => Try to get optimization to work

### Recursive types

    => Check recursive types implementation

### Simplification

    => Implement algorithm

### Text

    => Write text
    => Write poster

### Proofs

    => Write proofs
