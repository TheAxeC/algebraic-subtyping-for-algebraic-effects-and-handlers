This chapter is the start of the novel work that is accomplished. This thesis proposes a type system which is based on the algebraic subtyping system, but is extended with algebraic effects. \core is the name that will be used for this system. Algebraic subtyping has support for subtyping, but eliminates the disadvantage of having constraints. By using union and intersection types, subtyping constraints are explicitly coded within a type. \core adds algebraic effects into this system while simultaneously still preserving the properties of algebraic subtyping.

In this chapter, comparisons will be made to both \eff and standard algebraic subtyping. This is due to the additional intent that \eff will be revised in order to support algebraic subtyping. In section~\ref{typesterms}, the types and terms of \core is given. In section~\ref{typesystem} the equivalence between algebraic subtyping and regular subtyping will be explained. Section~\ref{typingrules} provides the standard typing rules for \core and the final section, section~\ref{reformulated}, reformulates these typing rules into a proper representation for algebraic subtyping.
