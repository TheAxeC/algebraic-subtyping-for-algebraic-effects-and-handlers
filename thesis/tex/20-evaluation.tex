Novel approaches to problems are often evaluated empirically. Describe the evaluation process in such detail that a reader could reproduce the results. Describe in detail the setup of an experiment. Argue why this experiment is useful, and what you could learn from it. Be precise about what you want to measure, or about the hypothesis that you are testing. Discuss and interpret the results in terms of your experimental questions. Summarize the conclusions of the experimental evaluation.
