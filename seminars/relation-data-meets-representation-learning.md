# Relational data meets representation learning

## 07 May 2018

## Was the level of presentation appropriate for the audience (e.g., was sufficient background information given)

I found the level of the presentation to be too high. I'm not familiar with representation learning, nor am I familiar with research surrounding relational data. I did not understand what the presentation was about in general, what problem was being solved.

Due to missing this background information, I had difficulties following the presentation. I could understand certain concepts during the presentation, allowing me to understand the material in some regard.

## What were the strong points of the presentation

The presentation made extensive use of visual material. This made the presentation more clear.

## What could be improved

Providing more background material.
