# Information Session for Master Thesis Students
## 02 October 2017
## Was the level of presentation appropriate for the audience (e.g., was sufficient background information given)?
The presentation didn't require any previous knowledge about what the Master's thesis entailed (or what kind of intermediary work is required). All necessary information was also given.

## What were the strong points of the presentation
* Everything was explained clearly.
* Some very important notes were given:
  - The speaker explained multiple times that we need to work hard on our thesis during the first semester (or we would lag behind)
  - The speaker noted that the thesis text that we need to write is very important

## What could be improved?
Personally, I already read the webpage with the guidelines for DTAI thesis students. Thus this seminar was quite redundant for me.

My improvement is not about the seminar itself, but about the material. I find it a bit annoying that most seminar topics aren't known yet even though the speakers are known.
