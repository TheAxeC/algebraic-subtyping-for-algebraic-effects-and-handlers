# Explicit Eff Subtyping

## 30 April 2018

## Was the level of presentation appropriate for the audience (e.g., was sufficient background information given)

The level of the presentation was appropriate for the audience. Background information to algebraic effects and Eff were given at an appropriate level.

## What were the strong points of the presentation

The presentation was pleasant to look at. The slides contained just the right amount of information, not too much and not too little. The talk itself flowed quite well together with the slides.

## What could be improved

Relatively towards the beginning of the talk, it was said that 3 calculi were developped. I found that not enough information was given for the reason behind this decision. At that point in the presentation it was unclear why SkelEff was needed for example.
