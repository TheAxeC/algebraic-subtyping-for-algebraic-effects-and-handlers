# On calibration in Machine Learning
## 23 October 2017
## Was the level of presentation appropriate for the audience (e.g., was sufficient background information given)?
I found the level of the presentation to be a bit too high for the audience.
The presentor started by assuming very basic knowledge and gave a good overview. 
However, later in the presentation, it felt like more machine learning knowledge and experience was required (regarding the beta-curve for example). 

## What were the strong points of the presentation
The presentation gace a good overview of basic machine learning.
Another strong point was that the presentation properly explained the purpose of the research that was being presented.
The presentation was very fluent and kept the interest of the audience.

## What could be improved?
Some of the later concepts could be explained more.
