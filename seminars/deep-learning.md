# Deep learning with neural networks and support vector machines
## 19 March 2018
## Was the level of presentation appropriate for the audience (e.g., was sufficient background information given)?
The presentation was appropriate for the audience. The required background is appropriate for computer science master students. The presentation explained every concept it introduced. For example, an introduction was given about perceptrons and slowly building up to deep neural nets.

## What were the strong points of the presentation
The importance of the information. Every technical concept (such as neural nets) was accompanied by advantages and disadvantages. The presentation appropriately balanced theory and applications.

## What could be improved?
The explanation was sometimes a bit monotonous in tone. I found this to be only a minor issue since the presentation and the content kept my attention.
