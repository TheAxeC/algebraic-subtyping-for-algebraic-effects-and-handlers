## Was the level of presentation appropriate for the audience (e.g., was sufficient background information given)?
I found the presentation to be a bit too simple. 
There was a part about programming features and their advantages and disadvantages. 
The given explanation was too simplistic.

## What were the strong points of the presentation
There was a strong "story" in the presentation. The presentation had a good flow and was easy to follow.

## What could be improved?
Give more details in the presentation about what certain advantages and disadvantages are.
