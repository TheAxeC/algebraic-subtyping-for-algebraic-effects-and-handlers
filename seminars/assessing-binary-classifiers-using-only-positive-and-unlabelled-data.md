# Assessing binary classifiers using only positive and unlabelled data
## 16 October 2017
## Was the level of presentation appropriate for the audience (e.g., was sufficient background information given)?
The presentation assumed basic knowledge of machine learning and probability theory. The audience consists out of Master's students doing a thesis within DTAI. Thus the presentation doesn't assume anything unreasonable.

## What were the strong points of the presentation
Drawbacks of the approach that was being discussed in the presentation were clearly explained. More specifically, one drawback is that the approach requires some external knowledge (fraction of unlabelled positives to the total unlabelled data) and that some assumptions are made (that known positives are a random sampling).

It was interesting that the final part of the presentation was dedicated to discussing results (both artificial and real-life data).

## What could be improved?
Sometimes, the slides were quite full of text. I think it would be better to have less text on the slides. That way, you keep the attention of the audience.
