# Meeting 06/10/2017

I worked out two concepts for possible type systems that I could work on for my thesis. These two systems are to either extend an type-&-effect system with intersection and union types and effects. The other approach is to try to find a way to make a modular system.

In the meeting, we found that the extended approach works best.
