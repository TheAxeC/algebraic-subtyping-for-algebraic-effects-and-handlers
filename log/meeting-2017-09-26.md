# Meeting 26/09/17

I explained my prior work. This includes the honoursprogramma and the row-based type-&-effect system that I made during the honoursprogramme. We went over the papers that I have read.

The most important paper is:
1. *Stephen Dolan and Alan Mycroft. “Polymorphism, Subtyping, and Type Inference in ML- sub”. In: Proceedings of the 44th ACM SIGPLAN Symposium on Principles of Programming Languages. POPL 2017. Paris, France: ACM, 2017, pp. 60–72. isbn: 978-1-4503-4660-3. doi: 10.1145/3009837.3009882. url: http://doi.acm.org/10.1145/3009837.3009882.*

I also received some additional (voluntary) reading material on intersection and union types:
1. *Compagnoni, A.B., 1995. Higher-order subtyping with intersection types. [Sl: sn].*

2. *Benjamin Pierce, 1991. Programming with intersection types and bounded polymorphism (Doctoral dissertation, Carnegie Mellon University).*

3. *Benjamin Pierce, 1991. Programming with intersection types, union types, and polymorphism.*
