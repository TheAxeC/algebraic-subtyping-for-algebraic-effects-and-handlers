# Meeting 03/10/2017

During this meeting, possible different type systems were discussed.

Using intersection and union types, there are several ways to use them within the framework of algebraic effects and handlers. I gave the advantages and disadvantages of several approaches.

By the end of the meeting, we came to two blueprints that I needed to work out further by next meeting. These two systems are to either extend an type-&-effect system with intersection and union types and effects. The other approach is to try to find a way to make a modular system.
