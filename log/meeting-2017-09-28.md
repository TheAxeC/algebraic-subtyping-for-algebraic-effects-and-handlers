# Meeting 28/09/17

This meeting discussed the research questions that I have formulated for my Master's thesis. These questions are:
- How can Dolan's elegant type system be extended with effect information?
- Which properties are preserved and which aren't preserved?
  * Instantiation, Weakening, Substitution, Soundness
- What advantages are there to an type-&-effect system based on Dolan's elegant type system?
  * Does the system lend itself to optimisations?

During the meeting, it was also discussed that type preservation is an important element that needs to be proven.

We also found that some additional advantages are needed. Optimisations is an important use-case, but it is long-term and it is always a good idea to have multiple use-cases.
- Runtime performance of the type system
- Better type-&-effect information given by the system to the programmer

There was a discussion on how the type-&-effect system should be made
- Separation of type and effect system
  * What type system should we use?
  * We can use union/intersection types by annotating with effect sets
  * Use union/intersection only for effects
    + Effects become a tree-like structure
    + Independent type and effect systems
    + This makes the effect system modular
    + Requires more proofs to be written
    + Effect system looks like row-based type system with intersection and union types
