# Meeting 06/11/17

Questions
* Polar types: dirt- empty and dirty- union

Next work:
* proof properties
* other proofs?

Further:
* biunification algorithm + type inference

Finally:
* implementation
* evaluation

Not 
* deciding subsumption:
    - needed for type checking when supporting type annotations (compare inferred to user-provided types)
