# Meeting 10/10/2017

I have worked out the types, terms, subtyping rules and typing rules of the type system that I want to create for my thesis.

Together with my daily advisor, we went over the different aspects to check them. Several small aspects were found that could be improved (such as reordering the rules to improve readability or clarify some things). By next meeting, I'm going to implement the improvements and make a draft for the type inference algorithm.
