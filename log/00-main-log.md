### August
[1], [6] and [7] were read during my honoursprogramme. These papers and others from Matija Pretnar, Daan Leijen, Daniel Hillerström and Sam Lindley describe algebraic effects and handlers. I have worked through this material during my honourprojects. During these projects, I designed and implemented a new type-&-effect system based on row polymorphism.

[8] is Types and Programming Languages, a book written by Benjamin Pierce. This books provides an excellent background for type systems, polymorphism and subtyping.

[4] and [5] were read during the summer vacation in August, while [2] was read in September. The prototype type inference engine [3] provided an implementation to play around with. These papers describe how ML-type polymorphism can be extended with subtyping. An advantage of this is that relationships between input and output types can be defined instead of just stating equivalences between input and output types.
