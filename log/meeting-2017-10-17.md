# Meeting 17/10/17

I have worked out the improvements for the types, terms, subtyping rules and typing rules of the type system that I want to create for my thesis. I also made the type checking/elaboration algorithm

Together with my daily advisor, we went over the different aspects to check them.
Errors:
* polymorphic let (polytype is defined with values, but let requires computation)
* cyclic subtyping rule (union of intersections and intersection of unions)

Improvements:
* remove row variable intersection/union sort
* make subtyping rules syntax-directed
* Add a top rule for dirt subtyping (set of all operations)
* Add equivalence rules

Questions
* Do we need dirt abstractions
* Can readability of subtyping be improved

Further work:
* Constraint generation

Notes:
* It may be too early to start thesis text
* I can start with implementation
